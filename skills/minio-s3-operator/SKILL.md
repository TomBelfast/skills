- Manage data lifecycle (Auto-expiry, transition).

### 2. Integration & APIs
- Integrate applications using S3 SDKs (Python, Node.js, Go).
- Implement **Presigned URLs** for secure uploads/downloads.
- Configuration of Webhooks for bucket events.

### 3. Performance & Scaling
- Tuning MinIO for high throughput.
