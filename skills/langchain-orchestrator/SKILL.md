# LangChain Orchestrator Skill

Expertise in building scalable, production-grade AI applications using the LangChain ecosystem.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
- Build composable and readable chains.
- Handle streaming and async execution natively.
- Implement fallbacks and retrying logic.

### 2. Advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword).
- Multi-query and self-query retrieval patterns.
- Parent Document Retriever and Contextual Compression.

### 3. Agentic Workflows
- Build agents with tool-calling capabilities.
- Implement LangGraph for cyclic and complex multi-agent state machines.
- Human-in-the-loop patterns.

### 4. Integration & Tooling
- Vector store integrations (Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant).
- Memory management (Zep, PostgresChatMessageHistory).
- Observability with LangSmith.

## Best Practices
- Always use `Runnable` interfaces.
- Separate prompt templates from logic.
- Implement robust error handling for LLM calls.
- Prefer Pydantic for tool schemas and structured output.
