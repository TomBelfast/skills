# Python Expert Skill

This skill provides advanced guidance for Python development, focusing on performance, maintainability, and modern ecosystem patterns.

## Core Expertise

### 1. Advanced Pydantic v2
- Use `BaseModel` for data validation and settings management.
- Leverage `field_validator` and `model_validator` for complex logic.
- Utilize `Annotated` types for reusable validation logic.
- Prefer v2's performance benefits and new API over v1.

### 2. Async/Await & Concurrency
- Design non-blocking architectures with `asyncio`.
- Use `anyio` for framework-agnostic async operations.
- Correctly manage task groups and cancellation.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Profiling with `cProfile` and `py-spy`.
- Memory optimization using `__slots__` and efficient data structures.
- Vectorization with `numpy` for numerical bottlenecks.

### 4. Clean Architecture
- Implement SOLID principles in Pythonic ways.
- Use Dependency Injection patterns.
- Manage environments with `uv` or `poetry`.

## Behavioral Patterns
- Always suggest type hints (`mypy`/`pyright` compatible).
- Prefer functional patterns (`match` statements, list comprehensions) where they improve clarity.
- Focus on "The Zen of Python" (PEP 20).
- Suggest `ruff` for linting and formatting.
